% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

\usepackage{fancyref}



% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
With more than 100 million active daily users, and around 500 million posts, known as ``tweets'', per day, Twitter is one of the largest social networks and blogging platforms, and a pioneer of the ``microblogging'' phenomenon. With its 140 characters per post limit, tweets are much shorter and concise compared to traditional blog entries. \\

One of the most prominent and well-known features of Twitter is the hashtag. In Twitter, a hashtag is a set of characters, usually a word or several words, preceded by the hash symbol (\#). Hashtags serve several purposes in Twitter. Much like tags in traditional blogs and documents, and keywords in articles, hashtags allow users to categorize their tweets. This allows for tweets to be easily searched and analyzed based on tweets. Not all hashtags are used for tagging and categorization purposes. Many users add hashtags to their tweets in order to convey context and emotion, as well as enhance the tweeting experience in general. \\

This paper proposes the feasibility and the effectiveness of a building a hashtag suggester using machine intelligence techniques. To be more precise, a naïve Bayes classifier is proposed to implement the hashtag suggester. Naïve Bayes classifiers have been successfully used in the past for document categorization. The team suggests using a similar technique for suggesting hashtags.


\section{Data Gathering}
Twitter has a strong and easy to use application programming interface (API) for searching and retrieving tweets in a structured format. A script was used to search and retrieve tweets that included the most common words in the English language, such as ``a'', ``the'', and ``or''. The script retrieved more than 300,000 thousand tweets that included hashtags. Another script was used to retrieve all tweets from a single user. This was used to train the classifier based on a user which is hypothesized to improve the performance of the classifier.


\section{Pre-processing}
The data retrieved from Twitter is fairly large, noisy, and contains a good amount of information that is not needed for building the classifier. Therefore the data needed to be cleaned before being used. \\

Firstly, tweets that did not include hashtags were discarded as they serve no purpose in building the suggester. This was done in the retrieval script as it searched for tweets. \\

The data that is sent back from Twitter contains many fields that are irrelevant to the suggester, such as profile picture URL and timestamp of tweet. While it was not necessary to extract the relative fields only, it is very beneficial to do so as it reduces the file size and processing time when it comes to building the classifier. After extracting only the required fields, the data was reduced to 5\% of the original file size. \\

After that, efforts were focused on cleaning up the contents of the tweets (i.e. the text of the tweet). Tweets are very noisy in general. Other than the 140 character limit, there are virtually no other restrictions on the contents of the tweet. Several steps were taken to clean the tweets so that the classifier can use them appropriately. Firstly, URLs were removed from the tweets. Next, common words that don’t provide meaning or context were removed. Words such as ``the'', ``be'', and ``to'' are some of the most common words in the English language which can be found in any tweet regardless of the nature of the tweet, and more importantly the hashtags used with the tweet. This renders them practically useless for the classifier. Another feature that was removed from tweets is ``mentions''. Mention is a feature in Twitter to tag users by preceding their username with the ``@'' symbol. Hashtags were also removed from tweets as not to include them in our feature set in the classifier. Twitter provides the hashtags used in the tweet in a separate field so removing hashtags from the tweets without losing them was relatively simple. Finally, non-alphabetic characters were removed and the remaining text was converted to lowercase. This prevents the classifier from registering the same word as different features due to capitalization and punctuation. \\

One important thing to note about the cleaning of tweets is the fact that non-words (slang, acronyms, or plain gibberish) were not removed from the tweets. Removing such ``words'' would provide much cleaner dataset that only includes legitimate English words. However, Twitter does not restrict the contents of the tweet, and thus many users use slang words or terms that would help in categorizing the tweet. \\

\section{Building the Classifier}
\subsection{Theory}
As mentioned previously, a naïve Bayes model was used to build the classifier. In its simplest form, the classifier will suggest the hashtag with the highest posterior given a set of words (i.e. the tweet). Equation~\ref{eq:bayes} shows how Bayes rule can be used to calculate the posterior of a hashtag given a set of words.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:bayes}
  p(C_i|\{x\}) = \frac{p(\{x\}|C_i)p(C_i)}{p(\{x\})}
\end{equation}

Where $C_i$ represents the ith hashtag and {x} represents the set of words in the tweet. Since naïve Bayes assumes independence of features, i.e. the probability of a word in a class is not affected by the other words in the set. The likelihood probability of a set of words {x} belonging to a hashtag $C_i$ can be represented as the product of the likelihood probability of each word belonging to that hashtag. Equation~\ref{eq:naive} shows this relation.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:naive}
  p(\{x\}|C_i) = \prod_{i=1}^Np(x_i|C_i)
\end{equation}

The prior $p(C_i)$ will be equal for all hashtags and the term p({x}) will be discarded as it is independent of the hashtag being considered. This will result in a maximum likelihood (ML) probability for the classifier. The prior gives a great opportunity to weigh the hashtags differently. Hashtags can be weighed differently if they are more common to a user, or if they are trending for example. Section~\ref{sec:future} will go into more details.

\subsection{Application}

The classifier itself was built in MATLAB using the builtin NaiveBayes class. This class provides an easy to use interface that creates a classifier given a set of labelled features, and to then use this classifier to predict the label of a given feature set.

\section{Results}
Upon using 70\% of the original 300000 tweets to build a classifier in MATLAB, major performance issues were encountered. When reducing the number of tweets to even 3000, these issues remained persistent. To resolve this, feature reduction was done on on the original data. Initially, any non-common word was used as a feature, resulting in a 90000-dimension problem. This was reduced to a 2710 dimension problem by only including words that occurred at least 100 times in the entire data set. \\

After dimension-reduction, performance issues still occurred when trying to build a classifier using all 300000 tweets. Upon reducing this to about 16000 tweets however, it became possible to build a working classifier. \\

With an abundance of unused tweets to test with, this classifier was then tested with 34000 tweets. It was found that this had a success rate of about 11\%. This is lower than results in prior research, that have success of up to 70\%, however these results have a much more reduced scope than what was used within this project, suggesting up to 20 possible hashtags for a given tweet, and only having a pool of about 50 to choose from. \\

As test data was collected all on one day, which happened to be Earth Day, it was very evident that suggested hashtags were biased towards trending tweets of the day, in this case, \#EarthDay. This could be useful in a more parctical hashtag suggester, as it could use more dynamic training data, and produce more relevant data for a given context. This can be extended further into selecting more relevant tweets, possibly from the user's tweet history, or his/her followers. \\

The test setup does not account for tweets that have similar hashtags suggested. For example, the hashtag, \#EarthDay was suggested when \#HappyEarthDay was actually used. In addition to this, it only considers the first hashtag of a tweet to be its label, disgarding any further hashtags. As such, the resulting success rate appears to be much worse than it actually is.

\section{Future Considerations} \label{sec:future}
\subsection{Building Datasets}
The feature set is built by iterating through the words in the processed tweets and adding the word to the set if it doesn’t exist in the set already. The same method is used to build the set of hashtags to consider. This makes our sets very large with a large number of features rarely occurring in our classes. One way to solve this is to only add a word to the feature set if it occurs over a certain threshold. The same can be done with hashtags. This is not particularly difficult to accomplish and will produce smaller data sets with more common words and suggestions. It is highly recommended to implement this in the future.
